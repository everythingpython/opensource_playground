## OpenSource Playground for Contributors

- Each of the 0* code files contains a bug in the code. 
- Additionally all the markdown files contain typos in them.
- Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to Fork the Repo, Fix any or all of the issues from the Issues tab and submit a PR.
- Unlike in normal OpenSource contributions, you don't have to wait to be assigned an issue to you. Feel free to mention in the PR which issue you're raising it for.
- All the reader who submit fixd PRs that render the output as expected will receive a mention in my next newsletter!
